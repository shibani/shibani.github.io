<strong><span style="color:#900">WHAT IS IT?</span></strong>  

Your team just got a new project assigned to you and you're all really excited because it's building out an interactive feature for the <strong>Game of Thrones</strong> website!  

There's only one catch -- there must be minimal changes to the legacy code that exists and was built by another dev shop.  

Enter the ~~dragon~~ <strong>visitor pattern</strong>.  

![dragon]({{ "assets/images/got-dragon.png"| absolute_url }}){: .right-image }

* The visitor pattern is a way to add methods to classes of different types with minimal altering of those classes.    
* It allows you to define external classes that can extend other classes without any major editing to them.  
* It leverages polymorphism and dynamic binding in order to achieve the desired results.
* Two parallel interfaces are created:
  * the visitor interface (Visitor, visit)â€¨    
  * the visitable interface (Visitable, accept)   
* You can create completely different methods depending on the class used
* This pattern promotes speed of extensibility.    

<strong><span style="color:#900">HOW THE INTERFACES WORK</span></strong>  

<strong>The Visitor interface</strong>  
We implement a `Visitor` interface (or module) and add one method to it.  This is the `visit` method.  All visitors that we subsequently create will have to implement this `visit` method.  

We then create classes to implement the behavior that we would like the original class in the legacy code to include.  We include the `Visitor` module in the new classes we've created, so they now `have` `visitor` behavior.   

<strong>The Visitable interface</strong>  
We do need to do just a little work in the original class for our pattern to come together.  

We go into the original class in the legacy code and add the `Visitable` interface (or module) to it.  This `Visitable` module also defines just one method, the `accept` method.  

<strong>This</strong> `accept` <strong>method takes in a</strong> `visitor` <strong>and enables that visitor's</strong> `visit` <strong>method to accept an object which is an instance of the original class.</strong> We can now extend this object easily!  

To summarize, the newly added and minimally modified code allows us to gain access to objects instantiated by the original class and add behavior to them without modifying the original class any further.  

<strong><span style="color:#900">WHEN TO USE IT</span></strong>  

When there is little to no access to the original class, or the ability to make modifications to it are severely limited.  
&nbsp;  
```ruby
# CLASS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND WITHOUT CHANGING  

class House
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)   
    @name = name
  end
end
```
&nbsp;  
```ruby
# STEP 1. CREATE MODULES TO EXTEND THE CLASS

module Visitor
  def visit(object)  
    "override implementation here"
  end  
end

module Visitable
  def accept(visitor)  
    visitor.visit(self)  
  end      
end
```
&nbsp;  
```ruby
# STEP 2. INCLUDE THE VISITABLE MODULE
# IN THE CLASS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND

class House
  include Visitable
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)   
    @name = name
  end
end
```
&nbsp;  
```ruby
# STEP 3. INCLUDE THE VISITOR MODULE
# IN A NEW CLASS THAT ADDS THE BEHAVIOR WE WANT

class AddPerson
  include Visitor
  attr_reader :first_name
  attr_reader :character

  def initialize(first_name, character, alive=true)
    @first_name = first_name
    @alive = alive
    @character = character
  end

  def alive?
    @alive
  end

  def get_person(visitable_object)
    status = alive? ? "Is alive" : "Is dead"
    puts "#{first_name} #{visitable_object.name}: #{character} guy"
    puts "#{status}\n\n"
  end

  def visit(visitable_object)         # IMPLEMENT THE VISIT METHOD
    get_person(visitable_object)
  end
end
```
&nbsp;  
```ruby
arya = AddPerson.new("Arya", "good")
stark = House.new("Stark")
stark.accept(arya)          
#=> Arya Stark: good guy, Is alive

ned_stark = AddPerson.new("Ned", "good", false)
stark.accept(ned_stark)     
#=> Ned Stark: good guy, Is dead

tyrion = AddPerson.new("Tyrion", "good")
lannister = House.new("Lannister")
lannister.accept(tyrion)    
#=> Tyrion Lannister: good guy, Is alive

cersei = AddPerson.new("Cersei", "bad")
lannister.accept(cersei)    
#=> Cersei Lannister: bad guy, Is alive
